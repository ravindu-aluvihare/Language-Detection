# üåê Language Detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

A simple machine learning project to detect the language of a given text input. This project uses text preprocessing, a CountVectorizer, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict the language. A web application is built using Flask to interact with the model.

---

1. **Text Preprocessing:**  
   Cleans and processes raw text to remove unwanted characters, special symbols, numbers, etc.

2. **Vectorization:**  
   Uses `CountVectorizer` to convert text into numerical vectors.

3. **Model Training:**  
   Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the processed dataset.

4. **Prediction:**  
   The trained model predicts the language of user-provided text inputs.

5. **Web Application:**  
   A Flask-based web interface allows users to enter text and see the predicted language.
